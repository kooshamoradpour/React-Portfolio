      <p>I am Koosha, and with over 10 years of experience in the medical biotechnology industry, I have witnessed the tremendous advancements in this field. However, I believe that it is now time to expand my knowledge further and explore new horizons. As a result, I have begun learning coding with the aim of merging it with my expertise in biotechnology and genetics.

My ultimate goal is to contribute to society by developing innovative methods that could improve the diagnosis, tracking, and treatment of brain cancer. By combining these disciplines, I hope to play a part in discovering new solutions and advancing the medical field for the benefit of those affected by this devastating disease.</p>
